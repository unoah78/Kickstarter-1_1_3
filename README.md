# Kickstarting with Excel

## Project Overview

Kickstarting with Excel project provided instructional information on 
different functions and tools that can be used when working with a 
dataset in Excel.

These lessons walked through how to:

- Filter columns, format cells and freeze a pain of a workbook.
- Finding averages for rows or columns.
- Creating Pivot Tables and inserting charts.

- Formulas that help identify relationships between values in the cells 
of spreadsheets while performing mathematical calculations using those 
values to provide resulting values in the desired cell.

## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

My analysis concluded that with Louis play costing $12,000 dollars.
Louis play would have a 54% chance of succeeding with a 46% chance of 
failing.

This conclusion was derived from analyzing the total number projects of 
(2066) and identifying the percentages that were successful, that failed 
and those that were canceled and categorizing them by a range of goals 
from less than $1000 through goals that were greater than $50,000.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

My analysis concluded that the best dates for Louis to launch the play 
would be either May followed by June.

These two months had the most *Theaters* launch with a greater percentage 
of succeeding vs failing.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The above results were challenging as they needed =COUNTIF formulas that 
needed to be strung correctly to provide the desire outcome.

Likewise for the *“Edinburgh”* task that needed =VLOOKUP formulas that 
pulled data from the *Kickstarter* tab to fills the cells in the below 
table.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on 
Launch Date?

1. May and June are the best months for Louis to launch the play.
2. Launching the play in December would not be a wise decision!
 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

1. If a project goals were less than $5000 there is a 74% chance at being 
successful. 
2. Projects goals that were between $5,000 and under $50,000 had a 50% 
chance of succeeding.
3. Projects goals over $50,000 yielded a 67% chance of succeeding.
